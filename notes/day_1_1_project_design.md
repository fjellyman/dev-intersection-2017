## SDP - Software Development Plan

If you only put good options in front of your managers.
"Never put _death_ on the menu"

There is no _the_ architecure, or _the_ project.
There are multiple ways of doing it.

Have to have a cost before the meeting with the steakholders.

Give the good options, or the plan to kill the project.
This will only lead to successful projects.

It's better to not waste time on a deadend project.
Actually try to kill deadend projects, so you don't waste carer time.

## Planning

If you want architecture, get an architect! 

## Fuzzy frontend 

Could be a few days, to a few years.

Complete dependencies at the beginning, so you know how things work before you start.

Factor of 2 dependcies

## Estimation

Don't go down to the hour or the day. 

Don't confuse the Unknown with the Uncertain.

When is a person going to die analogy.

- Pick a unit
- Box the estimation
- Use the quanity down to 5 in estimation.
    - Quantum of 5 days for delopment.

Don't place parameters on the amount of time it might take.
Never say how much time it takes without getting back to them with good estimation.

The critical path is the longest possible path it would take the project to be built.
The critial path is actually the quickest possible path that it could actually be completed.
