The application map is a good entry point for Application Insights.

Snapshot debugging: will open debugging in VS, including variables.

Stream Application Points of Interest using:

### Profiler

Paid version will allow you to take samples of code, and analyze them for choke points.
Will show you the good code too.

Azure has a few options for creating 'microservices': 

- Azure Functions
- Azure Service Fabric
