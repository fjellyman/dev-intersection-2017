# Moving Application Development and Test to the Cloud

## Dev-Test Labs

There are actual VMs that can be run for the Dev, and Test, environments.

https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/devtest-lab/

Automatically shut down the resources at a certain time period.

### Setup Full Evironments

- SAP Cluster evironment that can be shared

Use templates for quick setup, that is replicable.
Again, helpful for SAP.

Setup the evironment from a JSON file.
This could be pulled from Source Control.
